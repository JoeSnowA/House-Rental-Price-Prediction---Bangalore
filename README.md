# House-Rental-Price-Prediction---Bangalore

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
                   In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions can help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property management companies optimize their portfolio management. The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. By analyzing historical rental data and property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions

SUMMARY :
          
          After importing the CSV file, convert it into a dataframe. 
          Then, clean the unstructured and imbalanced data to create a structured format. 
          Perform data cleansing, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
          Finally, utilize the scikit-learn library to build machine learning algorithms. 
          Determine feature importance using XGBoost's feature_importance function.
          Finally, suggest the important features that affect rents for both tenants and house owners.
